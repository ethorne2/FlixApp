### Notes

### Notes
I realized I had just updated my phone to iOS 15 in the middle of this project. Since I wanted to be able to view the app on my device, I had to update Xcode in order to view on a phone with iOS 15. This resulted in a bug with Xcode updating in the Apple Store. I ended up successfully updating to Xcode 13 by removing and reinstalling the Xcode application. It added a few hours to my project, but I knew there was a great benefit to seeing this app and future apps deployed on a working iPhone.
